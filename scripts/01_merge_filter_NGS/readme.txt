	Silas' NGS Processing Pipeline - Version 8, Updated 01/08/2025
                           Contact: stmiller2@wisc.edu
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
This pipeline facilitates the merging of paired-end reads and quality filtering 
for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. There are options for processing 
single-end reads or paired-end reads without overlap, as well. Follow the steps
below to process your experiment efficiently.

Usage Instructions:
-------------------

**STEP 1:** Copy the entire merge_and_filter_starterpack directory and rename
 it to reflect your experiment.

**STEP 2:** Move all your fastq files from the sequencer to the 'Fastq/' 
 directory. Filenames should follow this format:
	- {samplename}_S{#}_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz #Forward read
	- {samplename}_S{#}_L001_R2_001_fastq.gz #Reverse read (paired-end only)

**STEP 3:** Set parameters in the `params.csv` file:

PARAMETER         | VALUE   	| DESCRIPTION
------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------
data_filepath     | filepath	| Path to the file you are running this 
	  	  |		| pipeline in
pear_filepath     | filepath	| Path to the PEAR executable
pear_overlap	  | int		| Minimum overlap for merging (see PEAR
	 	  |		| docs) - suggest 10
pear_stattest	  | int		| PEAR merging statistical test (see 
		  |		| PEAR docs) - suggest 1
pear_pvalue	  | float	| P-value for PEAR statistical test. Set
		  |		| to 1.0 to disable the statistical test.
merge		  | TRUE/FALSE	| Should typically be set to TRUE - merges
		  |		| reads with PEAR. If FALSE, all PEAR
		  |		| parameters are ignored and reads are 
		  |		| simply concatenated. Very slow.
singleend	  | TRUE/FALSE  | FALSE for merging paired-end reads;
		  |		| TRUE for formatting & filtering single-
		  |		| end reads. 	
compiler_filepath | filepath  	| Path to g++ executable (C++ compiler)
cpus              | int     	| Number of cores requested - suggest 8
memory            | int + unit 	| Amount of RAM requested - suggest 2G
disk              | int + unit 	| Amount of disk space requested - 
		  |		| suggest 60G
instrument        | string	| Instrument used to collect the data -
		  |		| miseq/nextseq/novaseq/nextseq_fox
q_floor           | int     	| Reads with any bases below this value
		  |		| are discarded
q_cutoff          | int    	| Reads with too many bases below this
		  |		| value are discarded (see cutoff_pct)
cutoff_pct        | float   	| Proportion of bases that must be at or
		  |		| above q_cutoff for a read to be kept
sample_names      | strings 	| List all sample names, each in their
		  |		| own column, as they appear in output
		  |		| Fastq files
reorganize        | TRUE/FALSE 	| If true, all final "good_reads.csv"
		  |		| files (and others) will be reorganized
		  |		| into a single directory

**STEP 4:** Move the entire directory to your scratch folder 
		cp -r {directory name} /scratch/{wiscID}

**STEP 5:** Start the processing run with the following command:
		./process_ngs.sh params.csv
	    Params will print to the console -- double check everything is
	    set correctly. 

**STEP 6:** Monitor the run progress via `run_progress.log`:
		tail -f -n 50 run_progress.log (exit using ctrl+C)

**STEP 7:** When finished, move the entire directory back to the fileserver.

**STEP 8:** Profit???
